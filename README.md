Info

These dotfiles have tweaked module:
- Clock -> `fixed wrong timezone with custome clock module.`<br>

And added new modules:
+ CPU temprature -> `Utilizes lm-sensors to display temprature since normal temprature module is a bit broken.`

Wallpaper can be found at <a href="https://github.com/42Willow/wallpapers">Willow's wallpaper dump</a>.
I am using Kitty terminal  with catppuccin-mocha colours since it comes out of the box.
Any folder with "(copy-contents)" requires you to copy the files inside the folder as the folder in the original folder in the ML4W filesystem is symlinked.*For catppuccin mocha the folder should be copied to `~/.config/waybar/themes`.

Many thanks to Stephan Raabe for creating the ML4W dotfiles.
